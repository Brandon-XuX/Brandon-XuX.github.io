                Melee weapons are hand-held weapons used by players in close quarters combat<br>
                against the infected that is within physical range. Such weapons are rarely <br>
                if not at all used by players unless under the pretense of having fun due the<br>
                extreme poor reliability and risk of using melee weapons against hordes of<br>
                the infected. <br>
