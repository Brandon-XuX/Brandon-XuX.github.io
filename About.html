                Welcome to the Those Who Remain fandom wiki.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                Those Who Remain is a wave-based zombie shooter game based off of the roblox 
                platform <br> created by Peak Development Studios officially released in December 21st, 2018. <br>

                Players are deployed in 5 minute long waves. The difficulty, number of waves,<br> and number of infected
                spawned every round depends on the game mode. As the waves <br>progressively get higher, the infected have more health, have
                faster speed, damage, and numbers. <br> The game ranges from havig a credits system for weapon and skin purchases as well as 
                in-game<br>loot as well as unlockable perks that function as power ups to increase a player's abilities. The waves <br>will reset and
                the maps will change either all the player's have died in a wave or have survived <br>the final wave.
