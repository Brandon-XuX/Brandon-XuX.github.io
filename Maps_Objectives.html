                Maps are the environment and setting where the players play in. Each map <br>
                has its own unique features, theme, style, and layout. Maps can be<br>
                categorized into normal (includes regular, hardcore, and classic game modes)<br>
                and endless which includes an infinite amount of waves while regular and classic <br>
                is only limited to 10 and hardcore being 20 waves. <br>
                <br>
                Objectives are similiar to quests that are availale to the players in waves. <br>
                Objectives can offer hefty rewards in exp and credits once completed. Only 2 <br>
                objectives can appear in a map at once. <br>
